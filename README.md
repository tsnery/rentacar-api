# rentacar
A project the helps you to organize and manage info about cars.

It is also a project that was made in order to learn backend development using NodeJS.

## This project taught me:

- Swagger, to create the project documentation
- Node Streams, a performatic way to handle with reading data
- Multer, to work with multipart data, i.e CSV file
- SOLID concepts, to write a readable code
